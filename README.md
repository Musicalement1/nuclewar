# Nuclewar

Nuclewar is (for now) a sandbox game where you can play arround with atoms and molecules and have fun with the physics simulation, which does things such as atomic fusion, molecule formations & more!

In the future, nuclewar might become a multiplayer game where people use their atoms to gain energy and more particles to expand, for example using Uranium fission to mess with the molecules of someone else & claim the atoms :p
